Scenario Reachability: 

In the past, scenario reachability has required the use of convex sets, and provides the sample complexity of a problem a-priori. 
We are going to instead use nonconvex scenario optimization. This takes on a "wait-and-judge" perspective and allows us to evaluate 
the probability of nonconvex sets a-posteriori. This approach is way more efficient than previous scenario reachability efforts. 
We can achieve acceptable probability bounds with a significantly smaller sample size. Specifically, we will calculate the reachable 
set using tiling with Basis Functions. This can be written as the following optimization problem:
