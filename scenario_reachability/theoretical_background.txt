Scenario Reachability: 

In the past, scenario reachability has required the use of convex sets, and provides the sample complexity of a problem a-priori. 
We are going to instead use nonconvex scenario optimization. This takes on a "wait-and-judge" perspective and allows us to evaluate 
the probability of nonconvex sets a-posteriori. This approach is way more efficient than previous scenario reachability efforts. 
We can achieve acceptable probability bounds with a significantly smaller sample size. Specifically, we will calculate the reachable 
set using tiling with Basis Functions. The mathematical formulation of this problem, along with the algorithm we will use, and numerical 
examples can be found in this folder in the PDF file. Note: The chosen algorithm runs on the scale of seconds. But to further convince everyone 
that this method is an effective approach, I will provide an a-posteriori empirical estimate of the reachable set using a one sided Chernoff bound 
to verify that the computed reachable sets satisfy the guarantee that they are epsilon-accurate.
