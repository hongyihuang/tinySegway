Scenario Reachability: 

In the past, scenario reachability has required the use of convex sets, and provides the sample complexity of a problem a-priori. 
We are going to instead use nonconvex scenario optimization. This takes on a "wait-and-judge" perspective and allows us to evaluate 
the probability of nonconvex sets a-posteriori. This approach is way more efficient than previous scenario reachability efforts. 
We can achieve acceptable probability bounds with a significantly smaller sample size. Specifically, we will calculate the reachable 
set using tiling with Basis Functions. This can be written as the following optimization problem:



We will use the following algorithm in our calculations: 

Note: this algorithm runs on the scale of seconds. Additionally, I have studied this algorithm on multiple examples (to be submitted as a paper for L4DC) and know it works effectively and efficiently. 

But to further convince everyone that this method is an effective approach, I will provide an a-posteriori empirical estimate of the reachable set using a one-sided Chernoff bound to verify that the computed reachable sets satisfy the guarantee that they are epsilon-accurate.
